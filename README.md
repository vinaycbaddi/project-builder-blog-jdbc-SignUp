# ProGrad Project Builder | Blog - Stage 2 (SignUp & Login)

Remember your client Mr. Alex? 

Well, he loves your work and is back for your help. He's reworking on the same project with the help of databases. Can you look into his requirements & sort things out?


## What Should You Do
```
Fork this repo
Clone this repo
Practice Java JDBC - connections, Statement and ResultSet.
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "ProGrad ID"
git push origin master

And finally, create a pull request so your ProGrad Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```

## Instructions

1. ***Do not modify the entire code.***
2. ***Edit the code as per the instructions.***
3. ***Go to Java Resources -> src folder.***
4. ***Your database connection code should exist inside the utlity package.***
5. ***Your crud operations should go inside the dao package.***
7. ***Create the connection object in the controller and call the respective methods.***
6. ***Once the progressions are completed follow the instructions to run the application and test your code.***
7. ***Add appropriate jars to your project directory.***


## Requirements
Download ojdbc6.jar from the given link [https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/jdbcdriver-ucp-downloads.html]

## Progression 0:
1. Right click on src folder and select new - file and name it as jdbc.properties.
2. You can use the jdbc properties given below in the NOTE section.

## Progression 1:
1. Create a class called as `ConnectionManager` inside the utility package.
2. Create a method public static Connection getConnection() which returns a connection object.
3. Use the method public static Properties loadPropertiesFile() to load the jdbc properties from the jdbc.properties file.

## Progression 2:
1. Create a class called as UserDAO inside the dao package.
2. Create a interface called UserDaoInterface with the following methods.
	- int signUp(User user)
	- boolean loginUser(User user)
3. UserDAO should implement the UserDaoInterface.
4. The signUp method is used to insert User details in the database.
5. The loginUser method checks whether the user exists int the database or not.


## Progression 3:
1. Create a model class called User with the following parameters.
	- **private String email**
	- **private String password**	
	- **private LocalDate date**
2. Include appropriate getters and setters.

## Progression 4:
1. Go to the controller class SignUpController inside the src/controller package.
2. Create object for the model class User and for the dao class UserDAO.
3. Pass the User as argument to the signUp method.
4. Call the signUp method and store the return value in a integer value called checkUser.

## Progression 5:
1. Go to the controller class LoginController inside the src/controller package.
2. Create object for the model class User and for the dao class UserDAO.
3. Pass the User as argument to the loginUser.
4. Call the loginUser method and store the return value in a boolean value called validateUser.


### Note:

Use the below code to retreive the connection details from jdbc.properties to establish connection
```
public static Properties loadPropertiesFile() throws Exception {
	Properties prop = new Properties();	
	InputStream in = ConnectionManager.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("jdbc.properties");
	prop.load(in);
	in.close(); 
	return prop;
}
```
Create a file called as jdbc.properites. To create a file right click on the application - new - file - name the file as jdbc.properties.
```
jdbc.properties
#JDBC properties entry for ORACLE server
driver = oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe
username=your_username
password=your_password

```

Happy Coding ❤️
